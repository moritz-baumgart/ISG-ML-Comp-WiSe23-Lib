This repo a submodule used in the following two repos:
- [ISG-ML-Comp-WiSe23](https://github.com/moritz-baumgart/ISG-ML-Comp-WiSe23) (Main repo)
- [ISG-ML-Comp-WiSe23-WSL](https://github.com/moritz-baumgart/ISG-ML-Comp-WiSe23-WSL) (WSL repo)

Please refer to the main repo for more information on the whole project.


## Usage of this repo
This library is used to make some data loading and preprocessing tasks that I frequently used in the main project a bit easier. When you want to execute code from the two repos mentioned above you probably need to have this library installed. You can install it with `pip` running the following inside the root directory of the repo:
```Shell
pip install .
```
